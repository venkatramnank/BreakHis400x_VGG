# Breast Cancer Images(BreakHis400x) VGG Classification

## Aim
This project contains the code for VGG 16 pre-trained model to classify Breast cancer images.

## Resources
The code can be found as a .ipynb file at 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aA6QujhwftACma3c93Urlva4i75_LwN5/view?usp=sharing'. Note: Please open the jupyter notebook with Google Colab.

The dataset is from 'https://www.kaggle.com/forderation/breakhis-400x'

## Language/Tools
-Python 3.x
-Tensorflow 
-Keras
-Keract

## Results
The accuracy obtained: 92 % on validation data

The below image shows the visualization of one of the CNN layers of a single image using keract activations.
